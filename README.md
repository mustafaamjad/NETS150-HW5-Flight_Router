Type: Graph and Graph Algorithms

Project Description: 
Our project, Flight Router, contains data of all possible airports, and flights in between these airports.
We use Reader and BufferedReader to get all the required data from our source website, X. 
We then create a graph with airports representing vertices and flights between airports representing edges. 

Thereafter, we allow for users to:
1. check all outgoing flights from airport X
2. check all incoming flights from airport X
3. check if user can reach destination in under X number of flights


Project Manual (How to run):
From the main function (FlightRouter), user can uncomment functions listed and enter data in order to retrieve relevant
flight information (assuming user inputs valid data).


Who did what: 
Mustafa - constructing graph
Shantanu - implement graph algorithms
